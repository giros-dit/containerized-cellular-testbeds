### Containerlab topology for server:
name: servertopo

### Topology nodes (entities/elements) ###
topology:
  nodes:
    server:
      kind: linux
      image: giros-dit/server:latest
      exec:
        # Interface with virb0:
        - ifconfig eth1 192.168.122.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
        # Configuring default route to use virb0
        - ip route del default
        - ip route add default via 192.168.122.1 dev eth1

    # Open5GS 5G Core N6 Interface (to PDN) is implemented as a Linux bridge (virbr0).
    # NOTE: This bridge must be created before deploying the topology.
    # It is automatically created after installing the libvirt package (and does NAT by default).
    # Subnet for this bridge is 192.168.122.0/24 (host is at 192.168.122.1).
    virbr0:
      kind: bridge

  ### Links between entities (Interfaces) ###
  links:
    # Interface with virb0:
    - endpoints: ["server:eth1", "virbr0:serv-internet"]
